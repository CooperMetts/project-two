            Camp Don Lee’s summer program is built around a group model that
            includes eight girls and eight boys of approximately the same age
            led by two trained and experienced counselors. The group is also
            supported by two program staff members from the waterfront, pool,
            craft, nature or operations staff. Small group camping is the unique
            trademark of the Don Lee experience. Within this model, the group
            grows in trust and faith as they work together, play together, and
            worship together. Year after year campers and alumni tell us that
            “the group” was so essential to the joy and excitement of their camp
            experience. Don Lee focuses on building the community of the group.
            Activities are fun and exciting but “the group” is where the real
            experience is built. Groups do not always start out in perfect
            relationships, but with willingness and sharing, growth in trust and
            trustworthiness can lift the experience to a real high moment in a
            camper’s life.

            Looking for one week camps at Don Lee? We are excited to offer
            opportunities for elementary and youth one-week campers to come to
            camp before summer officially begins, during our Early Camp Weeks.
            Campers will have an opportunity to participate in every activity at
            camp including sailing, archery, swimming, arts and crafts, nature,
            and more! All sessions are one week traditional.

          <p>
            Whether campers are coming with friends or on their own, they’ll
            become part of a small group family that is truly special to Don
            Lee. Campers participate in camp activities and learn new skills
            like archery, canoeing, kayaking, sailing, outdoor living skills,
            and more. They also will form a community through team building and
            nightly vespers. Swimming in the pool, campfires, field games,
            dances, talent show and more will be the highlight of the two week
            experience. Each two week group will lead a worship.
