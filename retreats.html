                These days, time away together in a beautiful setting is rare.
                Retreats at Don Lee offer the opportunity to be fully immersed in an
                experience away from life’s everyday distractions. At Don Lee, we
                specialize in hosting memorable retreat experiences centered around
                growth, fun and renewal for church, family, school and college
                groups. We offer a variety of cabin accommodations and meeting
                spaces. Our family-style meals feature home-cooked goodness to share
                together in our dining hall and to enhance your fellowship
                experience. Don Lee offers a variety of recreational activities that
                can be incorporated into your group’s retreat experience. We are
                located on the banks of the Neuse River, in close proximity to the
                mouth of the Pamlico Sound. At the property, the river is
                approximately 3 miles across, providing wonderful conditions for
                staff-led sailing during much of the year. Don Lee provides an ideal
                setting for retreats for children, youth and family groups in a
                relaxed and beautiful location to grow in your relationship with
                Christ. All basic retreat packages include lodging, meeting spaces,
                meals and camp activities. For an additional fee, spiritual
                programming for your group can be provided by our Don Lee minister
                and staff.

              <p>
                I remember the first time I came to Camp Don Lee - it was in
                November of my sixth-grade year. Local churches from all over came
                to Don Lee for a church retreat and my friend’s church in Greensboro
                had come once or twice before. That year my friend’s youth leader
                agreed that she could bring a friend, me.

                Going away for a retreat is something that initially caused me a lot
                of stress. Could I put everything away and just stop until Monday?
                Would my brain be able to shut down all the worries and just relax?
                Should I really skip the traditional worship service at my church to
                worship on the beach at the retreat? The answer to all of the above
                questions was, “YES”!
